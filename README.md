# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis - Python Data Science Project  

This project is based on the final assessment from the **UCD - Advanced Center (STAT40800)** course.  
It analyzes **Portuguese red and white wine** data using Python, applying **data exploration, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques**.  

---

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset consists of two CSV files:  
- **`winequality-red.csv`** → Red wine data  
- **`winequality-white.csv`** → White wine data  

A full description of the dataset is available in **wines.txt**.
