Dataset Description – Wine Quality
Overview:
This dataset is based on physicochemical and sensory data of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wines, available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes separate records for red and white wine samples, originally compiled for research purposes by Cortez et al. (2009).

Each entry contains results from analytical tests (e.g., acidity, sugar content, pH) and a sensory quality score (0–10) assigned by a panel of experts.

Dataset Content:
Red Wine Samples: 1,599 entries
White Wine Samples: 4,898 entries
Attributes: 11 input features + 1 quality score

Features (Input Variables):
-Fixed Acidity
-Volatile Acidity
-Citric Acid
-Residual Sugar
-Chlorides
-Free Sulfur Dioxide
-Total Sulfur Dioxide
-Density
-pH
-Sulphates
-Alcohol

Output Variable:
Quality - Sensory score from 0 (worst) to 10 (best)

Original Study & Usage:
The dataset was first introduced and analyzed in:

Cortez, P., Cerdeira, A., Almeida, F., Matos, T., & Reis, J. (2009).
Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.
Decision Support Systems, 47(4), 547–553.
DOI: 10.1016/j.dss.2009.05.016

Their study applied various data mining and regression techniques (e.g., support vector machines) to model wine preferences, evaluate variable importance, and test predictive accuracy.

Notes & Considerations:
The dataset does not include branding, pricing, or grape variety information due to privacy and logistical limitations.

Class distribution is imbalanced, with most wines rated around the median.

Potential for outlier detection, regression modeling, and feature selection analysis.

No missing values are present.

Dataset Used In This Project:
This project makes use of the full red and white wine datasets to explore, visualize, and model wine quality. All insights, analysis, and conclusions reflect my independent work and interpretations built upon the original dataset.
